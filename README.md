# cs426_fall2015

This is a senior project for CS426 completed with my teammates.

My teammates were:

  Bryan Hines
  Anthony Royle
  
In this case, I only had the role of attempting an AI and working on the user interface.

The game was made in Unity and was run during the senior projects show of late 2015 in an arcade cabinet.

This is not the latest version as I lost access to the original git for it, but it is close to what was presented.
